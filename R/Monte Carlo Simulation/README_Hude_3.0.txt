------------Code Information--------------
Current version: montecarlo_Hude_3.0_Robust.R. & montecarlo_Hude_3.0.R.

1. montecarlo_Hude_3.0.R : Run fast enough, but less robust as it is subject to capacity constraint of R and the computer used.
2. montecarlo_Hude_3.0_Robust.R : Much more robust. Can handle seeds that cause capacity overflow. This one uses methods of parallelization and chunck to control Errors "Maximimum Integer Limit" and "Memory Limit".

-----------Recent Findings----------------
The most recent attempts are based on the sample size of 1000x1000 with seed (31) and seed (894).
Seed (894) generates an extremely large dataset compared to seed (31), which causes many potential capacity issues.


-----------Result summary----------------
1. The newest version of the code and the workspace data are uploaded under montecarlo -> montecarlo_Hude
There are two additional folders: one contains the outputs (Images, Tables, etc), the other contains the past works for reference.

2. Presented an excel that contains copies of the dataframe generated by the program. But given that the sheets contain more than millions of entries, it takes a while to open the file.

3. The histogram "Connection per Estab":
The count of connections per establishment does not equal to the total number of workers moving to the public sector establishment. 
In fact, the value corresponded to each bar (each public sector establishment) is the total number of non-connection workers who have at least one connections belong to the establishment.In this sense, the value should be much higher since a person who moved to the public sector serves as a connection to more than one worker.
