## Overview

This Stata coding test was to analyze hospital technology adoption following Medicare policy changes, focusing on calculating the Saidin Index, running regressions, and visualizing results.

### Key Components

1. **Data Cleaning**: Merged datasets by hospital provider ID, retaining only matched records.
2. **Saidin Index Calculation**: Computed technology adoption proportions per year and generated a weighted index for each hospital-year pair.
3. **Regression Analysis**: 
   - Ran OLS regressions on hospital characteristics.
   - Performed fixed effects panel regression with treatment interactions (2001â€“2010) relative to 2004.
4. **Visualization**: Plotted the Saidin Index changes over time for treatment and control groups with confidence intervals.

This project demonstrates my ability to work efficiently with complex data, meet time constraints, and effectively use Stata for data analysis.
