## Introduction

I am a big believer that AI is beneficial for learning and productivity. Throughout my experience with programming, I have relied on AI tools extensively, both for learning syntax and generating programs that help achieve my goals. I started using ChatGPT when it first became available to the public, and over time, I have developed an effective strategy for crafting productive and efficient prompts. This allows me to instruct AI in ways that generate and debug code effectively.

This isn't to say that I don't know how to code—in fact, it demonstrates my ability to read, understand, and critically evaluate AI-generated code. By providing high-level yet detailed instructions, I can achieve most of the tasks I encounter. Of course, it’s not always perfect on the first try, as AI often produces bugs or misunderstands the objective. However, I see this as a skill, and I dedicate time to communicating with AI, debugging, and refining outcomes. I believe this is a valuable skill in the near future, as AI continues to evolve and play a greater role in programming.

## Repository Overview

This repository showcases my coding projects, including work from my time as a research assistant, independent research, and coursework. Below are four key projects that demonstrate my programming skills and ability to learn new tools. Additionally, I’ve included coding samples from coursework using **Stata**, **MATLAB**, and **R**.

### 1. **Econometrics Coding Test (Stata)**

As part of my RA application, I completed a coding test in Stata to analyze hospital technology adoption under Medicare policy changes. Key tasks included:
- Data cleaning and merging hospital records.
- Calculating a custom index (the Saidin Index) to capture technology adoption.
- Running regressions with fixed effects and clustering, and generating visualizations.
- Summarizing the results in LaTeX for a professional presentation.

This project highlights my ability to work under time constraints (completed in under 4 hours) and adapt to complex Stata programming tasks.

### 2. **Monte Carlo Simulation in R**

In this project, I simulated a labor market with 1,000 firms and tracked workers transitioning to public sector establishments. This was my first time using R, and I completed the project in one month. During this time, I learned the basics of R, data frame manipulation, and parallel computing. Key features of this project include:
- Simulating labor market transitions over a 48-month period.
- Identifying overlaps between workers who remained in the private sector and those who moved to the public sector.
- Producing visualizations and statistical summaries of public sector connections.

This project demonstrates my capacity to learn new programming languages and apply advanced computational techniques.

### 3. **Amazon Biome Coding Test (Python)**

This project was part of a coding test where I analyzed satellite imagery to track deforestation in the Amazon biome. I had no prior experience with satellite data or Python libraries like `rasterio`, but within three days, I managed to complete around 80% of the task. The main objectives were:
- Subsetting satellite data for the Amazon biome.
- Classifying forest and non-forest areas.
- Calculating deforestation rates.
- Visualizing forest cover changes over time.

This project highlights my ability to learn new libraries and adapt to different computational environments.

### 4. **SQL Code for Thesis Research: Network Effects in the PC Video Game Market**

For my thesis on network effects in the PC video game market, I wrote SQL queries for data collection, sampling, and cleaning. The dataset includes over 100 million Steam user accounts and is approximately 300GB in size. I used Google Cloud SQL to:
- Randomly sample 10,000 users and their direct and second-degree friends.
- Preserve network structure during sampling.
- Integrate game ownership data to study how network size affects game adoption.

Although this was my first experience working with large-scale SQL databases and Google Cloud SQL Studio, I quickly learned the necessary tools and optimized my workflow to manage such large datasets.

## Additional Coding Samples

Beyond these key projects, the repository also contains additional code samples from coursework, including:
- **Python**: BLP walkthrough.
- **Stata**: Econometric regressions.
- **MATLAB**: Simulation and machine learning tasks.
- **R**: Lasso regression and model selection, network formation using graph.

These samples showcase my experience across various programming environments and my ability to solve complex problems with different tools.
